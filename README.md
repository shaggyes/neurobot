# neurobot
Packages for ROS (extract in catkin work space -> catkin_make)

In each package there is pultneurobotX.py file which allows to try robot functions without ROS (open on pc)


neurobot - base func: voltage, current, US-sensors // start from python file on raspberry pi

neurobot2 - add time, filters, temp // start from python file on RPI

neurobot3 - same version as neurobot2 but starting with ROS on RPI (rosmaster setup required previosly)
